                        At Nami, omakase is an expression of trust. Each evening unfolds as a quiet dialogue between
                        chef, ingredient, and guest—guided by seasonality, precision, and restraint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our menu is shaped daily by what is at its peak, sourced from trusted fisheries and markets,
                        both local and Japanese. Nothing is rushed. Every cut, every movement, every course is prepared
                        with intention, allowing the natural character of each ingredient to speak for itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While our menu offers a curated structure, the spirit of omakase remains at the core of the
                        experience. Guests are guided through thoughtfully composed courses and selections, each
                        reflecting the season and the chef’s perspective. Whether choosing individual offerings or a
                        tasting progression, every dish is prepared with the same attention to balance, technique, and
                        timing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nami takes its name from the Japanese word for “wave,” a reflection of the rhythm that guides
                        our craft: constant, deliberate, and evolving. No two evenings are the same, yet each follows
                        the same commitment—to refinement without excess, and to an experience that lingers long after
                        the final course.
